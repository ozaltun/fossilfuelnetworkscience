# A preliminary Network Science analysis of fossil fuel trade data
This repository is some preliminary analysis conducted on fossil fuel trade. Global energy trade is mostly conducted through fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil. Understanding the dynamics of this network as well as some of its properties could be of some use. Global fossil fuel trade data was used to create a network[1]. .

This network was analyzed from a network science perspective. Visualizations of the model as well as basic parameters such as average degrees and total number of nodes were displayed for each year. Further analysis was conducted to see if the networks followed scale free distribution, potential ranking methods were tested, as well as community detection methods were analyzed. Contrary to other papers, the analysis shows that fossil fuel trade does not follow scale free distribution.

More detail and references will be added soon.
